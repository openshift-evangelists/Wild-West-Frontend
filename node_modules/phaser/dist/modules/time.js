/**
* This is the core internal game clock.
*
* It manages the elapsed time and calculation of elapsed values, used for game object motion and tweens,
* and also handles the standard Timer pool.
*
* To create a general timed event, use the master {@link Phaser.Timer} accessible through {@link Phaser.Time.events events}.
*
* There are different *types* of time in Phaser:
*
* - ***Game time*** always runs at the speed of time in real life.
*
*   Unlike wall-clock time, *game time stops when Phaser is paused*.
*
*   Game time is used for {@link Phaser.Timer timer events}.
*
* - ***Physics time*** represents the amount of time given to physics calculations.
*
*   *When {@link #slowMotion} is in effect physics time runs slower than game time.*
*   Like game time, physics time stops when Phaser is paused.
*
*   Physics time is used for physics calculations and {@link Phaser.Tween tweens}.
*
* - {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall-clock_time ***Wall-clock time***} represents the duration between two events in real life time.
*
*   This time is independent of Phaser and always progresses, regardless of if Phaser is paused.
